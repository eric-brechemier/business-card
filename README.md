My new business card (2019)

## Rationale

I have been using the same business card design from 2007 to 2019.
I had voluntarily left out my phone number and postal address,
to make the cards timeless. Still, twelve years is a long time,
and everything that appears on the card apart from my name has
now become outdated:

* after 15 years of work in "Software Design and Development",
  I am now becoming a graphic designer as well as a programmer

* the card featured my name and occupation in English and in Japanese,
  and was illustrated with the drawing of a Japanese rock garden,
  in tribute to ten trips to Japan across several years of fruitful
  collaboration with Japanese companies.
  But I have not returned to Japan in the last 10 years.

* it was a stock design and I now need a custom design
  to showcase my skills as a graphic designer

* I have grown tired of the custom email address used on my business cards,
  and I would rather use a new one which reflects my new occupation

* the card includes my Skype id, but I have stopped using Skype
  after [Skype dumped me][]

* my website address starts with `http` while today's Web requires `https`

## Dimensions

After reviewing the [various sizes][] of business cards commonly found in
different countries, I chose the [credit card size][] for the convenience
of storage in a credit card holder.
